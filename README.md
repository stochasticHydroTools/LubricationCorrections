# LubricationCorrections
Fast algorithms for applying lubrication corrections to fluctuating suspensions of spherical particles above a bottom wall

In order to run the code, the SuiteSparse library must be installed on the system
`http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html`

In Ubuntu 18, this can be accomplished by running
`sudo apt install libsuitesparse-dev`

In addition, the following python packages must be installed via pip

`pip install --user scipy`
`pip install --user pyamg`
`pip install --user scikit-sparse`
